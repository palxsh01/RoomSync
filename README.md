# RoomSync
The main objective of RoomSync is to develop an optimized roommate allocation system using operations research techniques. RoomSync is a data-driven model that ensures compatibility among students while allocating hostel roommates. The algorithm focuses on analyzing various lifestyle and behavioral preferences such as sleep schedule, cleanliness, sociability, study patterns, and noise tolerance, to name a few. By collecting this data through an online survey and applying an assignment model, the system aims to optimize roommate pairing in a way that minimizes conflicts and maximizes overall compatibility. Through this approach, the project demonstrates how Operations Research can be effectively applied to real-world decision-making and resource allocation problems, particularly in improving the quality of hostel living and enhancing the student's living experience.
